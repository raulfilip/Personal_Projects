Distributed Energy Management System
This project encompasses a multi-faceted Distributed Energy Management System designed to improve energy efficiency across various devices and user interfaces. 
Implemented using modern software architecture principles, the system integrates multiple microservices each handling specific functionalities such as
user management, device management, and real-time data monitoring.

Key Features:
Microservices Architecture: The system is divided into separate microservices that handle specific functionalities, improving modularity and scalability.
Real-Time Data Processing: Integrates a message broker to process data from smart metering devices, enabling real-time energy consumption analysis.
User and Device Management: Supports comprehensive CRUD operations on user and device data, ensuring detailed and flexible management capabilities.
Security and Authentication: Utilizes JWT and Spring Security to ensure secure communication and data transfer across the network.
Asynchronous Communication: Employs WebSockets for real-time communication and updates, enhancing user experience by providing instantaneous system feedback.
Docker Deployment: Containerized deployment using Docker, facilitating easy setup and scalability.
Load Balancing and Reverse Proxy: Utilizes Traefik for efficient load balancing and secure traffic management, enhancing performance and reliability.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Java Spring Boot, RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging.
Frontend: ReactJS for dynamic user interfaces.
Security: JWT, OAuth2 for robust authentication and authorization.
Deployment: Docker for containerization and Traefik as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
This system not only demonstrates advanced technical skills in handling distributed systems but also offers practical solutions to real-world problems in 
energy management. The architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and secure, making it suitable for high-demand environments where energy efficiency 
is crucial.
