   I've  developed my own version of the popular Frogger game using the ISA x86 instruction set. The game showcases the following elements:
Frog Character: You control a frog character equipped with three lives.
Dynamic Obstacles: The game world is populated with moving obstacles like cars and logs, which the frog must navigate through to avoid losing
a life. Beware of poisoned water!
Scoring System: Points are awarded for successfully navigating the frog across the map without losing a life. The better your performance,
the higher your score.
Keyboard Controls: The program is designed to recognize keyboard commands, allowing you to control the frog's movements, enabling you to hop in
various directions to avoid obstacles and collect points.
