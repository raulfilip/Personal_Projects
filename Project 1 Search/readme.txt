UC Berkeley Intro to AI - Project 1: Search
In this project i implemented:
Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.
Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm.
Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm.
A* search algorithm with Manhattan distance heuristic.
Corners Problem search problem formulation and heuristic implementation.
FoodSearchProblem formulation and heuristic implementation.
ClosestDotSearchAgent function to find the path to the closest dot.
Through this project, I implemented various search algorithms and problem formulations using Python. I gained practical experience in applying different
search strategies such as DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* to solve complex problems efficiently. Additionally, I learned the importance of designing effective heuristics
to guide search algorithms towards optimal solutions. This project deepened my understanding of artificial intelligence concepts and enhanced my problem-solving
skills in the domain of search algorithms.
