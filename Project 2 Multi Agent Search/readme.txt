UC Berkeley Intro to AI - Project 2: Multi-Agent Search
Reflex Agent (Question 1): 
Improved the provided ReflexAgent to play Pacman effectively by considering food and ghost locations.
Learned about feature selection and evaluation function design.
Minimax (Question 2):
Implemented an adversarial search agent using the minimax algorithm for multi-agent environments.
Gained a deeper understanding of minimax and its application.
Alpha-Beta Pruning (Question 3):
Developed a more efficient minimax algorithm using alpha-beta pruning.
Explored optimization techniques for game tree search.
Expectimax (Question 4):
Implemented ExpectimaxAgent to model probabilistic behavior in games.
Explored decision-making under uncertainty.
Evaluation Function (Question 5):
Designed a better evaluation function to assess game states in Pacman.
Learned about feature selection and weighing features for effective evaluation.
Overall, this project provided practical experience in AI techniques, including search algorithms, adversarial search, and evaluation function design,
within the context of the Pacman game.
