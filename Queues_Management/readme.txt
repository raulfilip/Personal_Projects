      This project entails simulating the customer-cashier interaction process within a retail store environment. 
Developed using Java, this project empowers users to define parameters such as the quantity of customers, the number of checkout counters,
the simulation's duration, and the range for arrival and service time variations. These inputs facilitate the generation of random customers
with diverse arrival and service time profiles. Customers are then placed into the queue with either the shortest waiting time or the one 
with the fewest customers, depending on the selected strategy.
Key information regarding this project: 
Input Parameters:
Number of customers
Number of checkout counters
Simulation duration
Range of arrival time variation
Range of service time variation
Functionality: The project simulates the arrival and service process of customers at checkout counters. It prioritizes the queue with the 
minimum waiting time, ensuring efficient service. Additionally, the program calculates two important metrics:
Average Waiting Time: It computes the average time customers spend waiting in line.
Peak Hour Analysis: It identifies the time period during the simulation with the highest customer traffic, helping to optimize store operations.
This Java-based project provides insights into customer-cashier interactions, helping businesses enhance their service efficiency.
