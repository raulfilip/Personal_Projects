This application emulates the hardware implementation of a modern washing machine using the VHDL language, and it's executed on a Basys 3 board.
Key features of  the project:
User Interface: Users interact with the application by utilizing switches on the board to select washing modes. They can choose from three preset
modes or customize one to meet their specific requirements.
Customization Options: In manual mode, users can adjust settings like temperature, the number of rotations per minute, and the inclusion of pre-wash
or additional rinsing.
Time Calculation: The program calculates the time required for washing based on the selected settings.
Remaining Time Display: Once the user presses the start button, the application displays the remaining time until the washing cycle is completed on
the Seven-Segment Display (SSD).
This project effectively replicates the functionality of a modern washing machine and provides users with the flexibility to tailor their washing
cycles to their needs.
